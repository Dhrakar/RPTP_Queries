### UA RPTP Schema SQL scripts and snippets ###
These snippets of SQL and Toad files are intended to be used to pull various information from the UA Banner RPTP data warehouse and OnBase tables.  You will need HR, Finance, Student, FinancialAid or some combination of those privileges, as appropriate, to be able to run these queries.

Many of these scripts are works in progress and I'm always on the lookout for better ways to do them.  Please let me know if you spot any typos, logic errors, anomalies or just plain bad code.  Thanks!
